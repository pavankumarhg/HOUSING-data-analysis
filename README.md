# HOUSING-data-analysis
This project involves analyzing housing market data to uncover key insights into average housing prices, sales volume, and crime rates across different regions. The analysis was performed using Python with the following key steps:

Data Loading and Exploration: Utilized Pandas to load and explore the dataset, containing information on housing prices, sales, and crime statistics from 1995 onwards.
Summary Statistics: Generated descriptive statistics to understand the distribution and variability of key features such as average_price, houses_sold, and no_of_crimes.
Data Visualization: Employed Matplotlib to create visualizations for identifying trends in housing prices and crime rates over time and across regions.
Insights Generation: Extracted actionable insights into the relationship between housing prices and crime rates, which can inform real estate investment strategies or policy decisions.
This project demonstrates proficiency in data cleaning, statistical analysis, and data visualization with Python.
